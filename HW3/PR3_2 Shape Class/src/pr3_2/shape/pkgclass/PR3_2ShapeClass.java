/*
PR3_2: Shape Class Hierarchy

Create classes for Shape, Triangle, Rectangle, and Ellipse. Shape is defined as 
follows:

public class Shape {
	public double getArea() {return 0;}
	public double getPerimeter() {return 0;}
}

Triangle, Rectangle, and Ellipse should inherit from Shape. The constructors 
should be defined as follows:

public Rectangle(int width, int height)
public Ellipse(int r1, int r2)
public Triangle(int s1, int s2, int s3)

Use exception handling to make sure the arguments for any functions you 
implement are legal (e.g. lengths should be greater than or equal to 0). 
Beware, the Triangle sides have specific rules that should be obeyed! 
Mark the constructors as “throwing” functions. Override the Shape functions 
for each class. Override methods from Object as appropriate.
